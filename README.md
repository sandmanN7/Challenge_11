# Challenge_11
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to further develop a webpage that allows a user to search for UFO events/sightings using JavaScript. The original webpage only has a filter for the date, but the new one has filters for the city, state, country, shape of UFO as well as the date.

## Results
The page has five distinct filters from which a user can look for specific items in a UFO event/sighting

You can input only one item and the page will show all events with that item.

You can also input multiple items and events with those items will be returned.

### Summary
One drawback of this new design is that it does not incorporate a time duration filter, which could be important to some people who are interested in specific time dynamics of these events. One improvement for this page could be to add a filter which includes a range of time to filter events by duration. Another improvement could be to fix the date filter to include a range of dates instead of one day, since a user might be interested in a week or a month of sightings.
